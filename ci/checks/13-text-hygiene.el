;;; 13-text-hygiene.el --- hygiene for every text file -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Every file tracked by git that is not binary, Emacs Lisp included:
;; no trailing whitespace and exactly one final newline.  This is the
;; check that covers files the package checks never look at, such as
;; ci/, .github/, README and .gitignore.

;;; Code:

(defun p/binary-file-p (file)
  "Return non-nil if FILE contains a NUL byte."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents-literally file)
    (search-forward "\0" nil t)))

(defun p/text-hygiene-file (check root rel)
  "Report hygiene issues for REL under ROOT."
  (let ((full (expand-file-name rel root)))
    (when (and (file-regular-p full)
               (not (p/binary-file-p full)))
      (let ((content (with-temp-buffer
                       (insert-file-contents-literally full)
                       (buffer-string))))
        (unless (string-suffix-p "\n" content)
          (p/add-error check full nil "missing final newline"))
        (when (string-suffix-p "\n\n" content)
          (p/add-error check full nil "more than one final newline"))
        (let ((line-num 0))
          (dolist (line (split-string content "\n"))
            (setq line-num (1+ line-num))
            (when (string-match-p "[ \t]+\r?$" line)
              (p/add-error check full line-num "trailing whitespace"))))))))

(p/defcheck-global text-hygiene :scope "every tracked text file"
  "Every tracked text file: no trailing whitespace, one final newline."
