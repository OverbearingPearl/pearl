;;; 15-project-neutral.el --- no project names in the copyable parts -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; `ci/' and `.github/' are meant to be copied into another Emacs Lisp
;; package as they are.  The package name showing up there defeats that
;; quietly: the copy lints, the copy runs, and the copy still tells every
;; reader it belongs to somebody else.
;;
;; So the name may not appear in either tree.  It is derived from the main
;; file, never written down here -- which is also why this check has nothing
;; to search for until it runs, and why the check itself is covered by it.

;;; Code:

(require 'seq)
