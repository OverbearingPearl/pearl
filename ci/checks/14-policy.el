;;; 14-policy.el --- policy tables and registry agree -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Guards the policy's own structure, because a silent mistake there
;; disables a rule instead of failing: a class misspelled in a profile or
;; in a check's :classes means that check simply never runs.
;;
;; Checked here: every known class has a profile with all three
;; properties, every class a profile names exists, every header set
;; resolves, and every class a check claims exists.

;;; Code:
