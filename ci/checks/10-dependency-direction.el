;;; 10-dependency-direction.el --- module layering -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; A module may only require features whose class is listed in its own
;; class profile's :may-require.  Requires of features outside the
;; repository are ignored.

;;; Code:

  "Module requires must follow the configured layer rules."
